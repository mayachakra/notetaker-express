## Description
For this assignment I created a notetaking web-app using starter code and utilized routing. By organizing my files in a certain manner, I was able to successful route the classes,
html pages, and the database to work together so that when a user creates a note on the site, they can clear the form, submit their note, have it saved and shown for access and
they can also delete it with a trash icon. All this information is saved in the db.json file where read and write functions allow for these actions to occur to match the site information
with that of the database.
